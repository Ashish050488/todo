# Backend Project

This is a backend project built with Node.js and MongoDB. It includes essential features like authentication, task management, and more. This README provides details about setting up the environment and running the project.

## Features

- **RESTful API** for handling requests.
- **MongoDB** as the database for storing data.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure access to user-specific data.
- **Environment Variables** configuration via `.env` file.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- dotenv (for environment variable management)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (v4.x or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashish050488/todo.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MongoUri=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   ```

   - `PORT`: Specifies the port number for the backend server.
   - `MongoUri`: Connection string for your local MongoDB instance. Replace `your-database-name` with the name of the database you want to use.

4. Start the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you have specified in the `.env` file).

## Endpoints

Here are some of the key API endpoints available:

### POST `/tasks`
